        Does this sound like what you want for yourself?
        </span>
        </p>
        <p>
If yes, you have the chance to achieve everything starting from today.
</p>
<p>
    <span>
The truth is,
</span>
</p>

<p>If we decide to charge you N400k to get access to all of these today, it is going to be a steal.</p>

<p>
And No, you're still Not even paying up to N300k to get access to it today
</p>
<p>
Is it N200k?Â 
</p>
<p>
No, it's way more affordable for you.
</p>
<p>
All you have to do is pay a commitment fee of just <span>N150k</span> to get access to all the benefits listed above and get proper Product Management training.
</p>
<p>
To make this even better, you can split the tuition payment into 2 payments;
</p>
<p>
N80,000 on admission, N70,000 after a month during the training.
</p>
