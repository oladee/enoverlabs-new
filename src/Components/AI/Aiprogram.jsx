              The AI for Product Management Course delves into the integration
              of AI within product management, covering its role across the
              development life cycle, strategies for integrating AI-powered
              features effectively, and the importance of perceiving AI as a
              strategic asset rather than a risk.

              Upon successful completion of the course and exam, you'll receive
              an "AI for Product Management" badge for your professional
